# Rainmeter-WinDynamicWallpapers (WIP)
A Rainmeter plugin to change Windows desktop wallpapers dynamically.

Currently the work is focused on the backbone console application and its command-line system.
Only when it has completed feature development & integration testing that the Rainmeter skin will be developed,
for it requires a flexible and effective command-line system to base Rainmeter interop on.

# Planned features
- Automatically retrieve latest satellite imagery from GOES EAST, GOES WEST, Meteosat-8, Meteosat-11, and JAXA's Himawari weather satellites
- Updates Windows's desktop wallpaper periodically from image sources' most recent feeds
- Ability to configure customized per-monitor slideshows
- Faking per-monitor wallpaper settings (e.g background color) by automatically creating matching-size images as wallpapers
